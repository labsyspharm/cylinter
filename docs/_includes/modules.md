1. `getSingleCellData`: This module aggregates single-cell data from all tissues into a single dataframe for subsequent redaction by downstream modules; user interaction is not required.

2. `selectROIs`: In this module, polygon selection tools built into the Napari image viewer (triangle, circle, and square icons) are used to gate on tissue regions of interest (ROIs). Positive and negative selection modes are available (see the `delintMode` parameter in `config.yml`). In positive selection (default), cells within ROI boundaries are carried forward into downstream analysis. In negative selection, selected cells are dropped from the analysis. Negative selection may be preferred for datasets exhibiting diffuse optical artifacts. Closing the Napari window after drawing ROIs for a given causes the program to advance to the next tissue for ROI selection. Closing the window without drawing an ROI is equivalent to selecting all cells from that tissue. ROI polygon vertices are stored as key:value pairs in `<cylinter_output_path>/ROI/polygon_dict.pkl`. This file must be removed (or individual key:value pairs must be deleted) in order to re-define ROIs.

3. `dnaIntensityCutoff`: Out-of-focus and mis-segmented cells tend to have lower nuclear counterstain signal intensities (e.g. Hoechst, DAPI) compared to in-focus and accurately-segmented cells. Conversely, very bright nuclei may be caused by overlapping cell nuclei as a consequence of tissue folding, which can lead to poor nuclei-based segmentation performance. In this module, histograms of mean nuclear counterstain signal intensity are presented to users as interactive Matplotlib widgets with sliders for upper and lower nuclear signal intensity cutoff assignment. After gate placement, users can visualize where the selected cells reside in a tissue of interest by entering the name of the target tissue into the provided provided text box at the bottom of the widget. A Napari window will then open showing the nuclear counterstain channel (first cycle in multi-cycle experiments) with scatter points at the nuclear centroids of the cells which will be carried forward into downstream analysis. Scatter points are colored according to the nuclear signal intensities of selected cells. Segmentation outlines are also provided as a fiducial reference. Closing the histogram window (or its associated Napari windows) causes the program to apply the current settings and proceed to the next tissue for thresholding. Closing the histogram window without adjusting sliders is equivalent to selecting all cells from that tissue.

4. `dnaAreaCutoff`: Cell segmentation errors introduce significant error into quantitative single-cell feature tables. In this module, users assign lower and upper cutoffs on cell segmentation area (calculated as the total pixel number for each segmentation instance by [MCMICRO](https://mcmicro.org/) in the removal of cells which are over- and under- segmented.

5. `crossCycleCorrelation`: This module, pertinent to multi-cycle imaging studies only, is designed to remove cells from the analysis which had became detached from the microscope slide over the course of imaging. This phenomenon, referred to as cell-dropout, causes false-negative signal intensities for all immunomarkers used subsequent to the cell-dropout event. To remove cell-dropout, users apply lower and upper gates on the log<sub>10</sub>-transformed ratio of nuclear counterstain signals between cells at the first and last imaging cycles (log<sub>10</sub>(cycle<sub>1</sub>/cycle<sub>n</sub>) for a given tissue. Users adjust sliders to select cells with highly-correlated signals centered around zero (as log<sub>10</sub>(x/x) = 0). After gate placement, users can visualize where the selected cells reside in a given tissue by entering the name of the target tissue into the provided provided text box at the bottom of the widget. A Napari window will then open showing the nuclear counterstain channels for the first and last imaging cycles together with scatter points at the nuclear centroids of the cells which will be carried forward into downstream analysis based on current gate settings. Tissues exhibiting relatively little tissue loss may be gated by applying a single cutoff to histogram y-axes (counts). In this method, users first visualize histograms for all tissues in the analysis then enter a cutoff into the provided text box, which causes the histograms to be re-rendered with a horizontal line at the assigned cutoff for confirmation or refinement. Y-axis gating may be toggled using the `cutoffAxis` parameter in `config.yml`. Although y-axis gating expedites the gating procedure, it may be unsuitable for tissues with large amounts of cell loss.

6. `log10transform`: This module performs log<sub>10</sub>-transformation on raw immunomarker signal intensities; user interaction is not required.

7. `pruneOutliers`: Cells affected by antibody aggregates and spurious optical artifacts can appear as outliers in the affected channel(s) which can negatively impact unsupervised clustering results. In this module, users can elect to crop extreme outliers from the analysis by removing the fist and last n-percentiles of cells for a given immunomarker channel. Scatter plots (or alternatively hexbins) of channel signal intensity versus cell segmentation area are visualized for all samples before entering a comma-delimited pair of lower and upper percentile cutoffs into the provided text box (range: 0.0-100.0). Plots are then re-rendered with outliers removed for confirmation or refinement. Hexbins are recommended for larger datasets to reduce plot rendering times and can be toggling the `hexbins` parameter in `config.yml`. Closing the text box window causes the current cutoff settings to be applied and the program to proceed to the next channel for cutoff assignment. Closing the text box window without entering cutoffs is equivalent to selecting all data points for that channel. Once cutoff assignments have been made for all channels, the program applies the cutoffs to the data in the same order in which they were defined then re-scales channel signal intensities between 0 and 1 to normalize channel signal intensities. Percentile cutoffs are stored as key:value pairs in `<cylinter_output_path>/pruning/pruning_dict.pkl`. Remove `pruning_dict.pkl` to re-define cutoffs.

8. `metaQC` (optional): The metaQC module is designed to correct for data mis-classification that may have occurred due to gating inaccuracies. This module draws equal numbers of cells considered "clean" and "noisy" at random, then performs density-based, unsupervised clustering by [HDBSCAN](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) on them. Users are presented with an interactive plot showing the tSNE or UMAP embedding (see `config.yml`) colored by HDBSCAN cluster at left and QC status as clean or noisy at right. A text box located above the plots is provided to allow users to change the minimum cluster size (`min_cluster_size`, integer values), which automatically re-renders the HDBSCAN plot with the updated cluster labels. To aid in identifying a stable clustering solution, a range of hyphen-delimited `min_cluster_size` values may also be entered into the text box (#-#). This causes the program to loop over values within the range and print to the terminal window the number of clusters associated with each value without updating the HDBSCAN plot. Experienced users may also wish to adjust additional clustering parameters which can be achieved by editing the source code for this module in `/Users/<user>/cylinter/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cylinter/components.py`. Using the `reclassCutoff` parameter in `config.yml`, users will have specified a tolerance limits on the proportion of clusters composed of clean and noisy data for all cells in that cluster to be considered data of a certain type; ambiguous (or unclustered) cells maintain their original annotations. Typing ".save" after a `min_cluster_size` causes the program to reclassify data according to the current clustering solution and reclassification cutoffs (see `reclassCutoff` parameter in `config.yml`). This module can be bypassed by toggling the `metaQC` parameter in `config.yml`.

9. `PCA`: This module performs principle component analysis (PCA) on mean immunomarker signal intensities for sets of tissues (see `config.yml` for details). The resulting PCA scores plot is saved in `<cylinter_output_path>/pcaScoresPlot.pdf`.

10. `clustering`: This module performs density-based, hierarchical clustering (HDBSCAN) on tSNE or UMAP embeddings of data from the redacted dataframe. An optimal clustering solution is identified using the procedure described in the `metaQC` module (above). Typing ".save" after a `min_cluster_size` causes the program to append the current cluster IDs to the redacted dataframe and proceed to the next module.

11. `getClustermap`: This module computes a hierarchically-clustered heatmap of mean immunomarker signal intensities for clusters identified in the `clustering` module (above). Closing the heatmap preview window causes the figure to be saved in `<cylinter_output_path/clustering/final/clustermap.pdf>` and the program to proceed to the next module.

12. `frequencyStats`: Computes pairwise statistics for binary declarations specified in the `sample_metadata` dictionary in `config.yml` (third elements). Statistical results are saved in `<cylinter_output_path>/clustering/final/frequency_stats/`. This module is automated and configurable; see `config.yml` for details.

13. `setContrast`: In this module, the Napari image viewer is used to adjust image contrast settings on a reference tissue specified by the `viewSample` parameter in `config.yml`, which are applied to all tissues in the analysis and used by the `curatethumbnails` module (below). Users toggle channels on and off by clicking on their respectively-labeled buttons at the left-hand side of the Napari window and moving the lower and upper sliders on the "contrast limits" control bar in the upper-left of the Napari window; the lower slider thresholds background signal intensities, while the upper slider increases channel gain. Closing the Napari viewer stores the current settings as key:value pairs in `<cylinter_output_path>/contrast_limits.yml` and causes the program to proceed to the next module. Remove the `contrast_limits.yml` file (order update specific key:value pairs) to re-define image contrast settings.

14. `curateThumbnails`: This module programmatically generates image galleries of cells drawn at random from each cluster identified in the `clustering` module. Image contrast settings defined in the `setContrast` module are applied to images prior to thumbnail curation. A single white pixel corresponding to the nuclear centroid of the reference cell is shown in each image as a fiducial reference for the reference cell. The number and size of thumbnail examples can be specified using the `numThumbnails` and `squareWindowDimension` parameters in `config.yml`.  Images can also be saved with segmentation outlines superimposed by toggling the `segOutlines` parameter in `config.yml`. Image galleries per cluster are saved in `<cylinter_output_path>/clustering/final/thumbnails/`.
