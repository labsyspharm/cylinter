3\. `intensityFilter`: Out-of-focus, mis-segmented, and counterstain-oversaturated cell nuclei tend to have altered signal intensity values relative to in-focus, accurately segmented cells. In this module, users interact with histogram widgets of mean counterstain signal intensity and imaging data to assign upper and lower cutoffs on DNA intensity. Users can visualize selected cells in a given tissue which are colored according to DNA signal intensity. Segmentation outlines are provided as a fiducial reference for evaluating proper cutoff assignments. Selected data points are carried forward into downstream analyses. Closing the Napari window causes the program to apply the current cutoffs and proceed to the next tissue in the batch.
