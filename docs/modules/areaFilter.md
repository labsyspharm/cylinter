4\. `areaFilter`: Cell segmentation errors introduce significant error into microscopy-derived, single-cell data. In this module, users assign lower and upper cutoffs on the distribution of segmentation area (total pixels) for cells comprising each tissue as calculated by the quantification module in [MCMICRO](https://mcmicro.org/) to remove under- and over-segmented cells. Closing the Napari window causes the program to apply the current cutoffs and proceed to the next tissue in the batch.
