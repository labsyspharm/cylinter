## An Interactive Image Segmentation Filter for Multiplex Microscopy.

CyLinter is quality control software for identifying and removing cell segmentation instances corrupted by optical and/or image-processing artifacts in multiplex microscopy images. The tool is user-guided and comprises a set of modular and extensible QC modules instantiated in a configurable [Python](https://www.python.org) Class object. Module results are cached to allow for dynamic restarts.

CyLinter development is led by [Greg Baker](https://github.com/gjbaker) at the [Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology](https://labsyspharm.org/), Harvard Medical School.

**Funding:** This work was supported by Ludwig Cancer Research and the Ludwig Center at Harvard and by NIH NCI grants U2C-CA233280 (Omic and Multidimensional Spatial Atlas of Metastatic Breast and Prostate Cancers) and U2C-CA233262 (Pre-cancer atlases of cutaneous and hematologic originâ€”PATCH Center) to Peter K. Sorger and Sandro Santagata as part of the Human Tumor Atlas Network. Development of computational methods and image processing software is supported by a Team Science Grant from the Gray Foundation, the Gates Foundation grant INV-027106, the David Liposarcoma Research Initiative, and the Emerson Collective.
