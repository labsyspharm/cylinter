## An Interactive Image Segmentation Filter for Multiplex Microscopy.

CyLinter is quality control software for identifying and removing cell segmentation instances corrupted by optical and/or image-processing artifacts in multiplex microscopy images. The tool is interactive and comprises a set of modular and extensible QC modules instantiated in a configurable [Python](https://www.python.org) Class object. Module results are cached to allow for progress bookmarking and dynamic restarts.

CyLinter development is led by [Greg Baker](https://github.com/gjbaker) at the [Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology](https://labsyspharm.org/), Harvard Medical School.
